It is more harmful to compromise one's own beliefs than to adhere to them. Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take.

我们在读题的时候一定要认真读下面的详细的要求。这个题目明确指出在形成我们自己的观点的时候，我们要考虑到给定的说法正确和不正确的情况，以及这些情况对于我们的立场的影响。既然这样我们完全可以来个具体情况具体分析。一方面承认有些情况下确实是妥协不如坚持。然后第三段我们再反过来指出其他的情况下还是妥协更好。这样写既扣题，又能大大的降低我们的构思难度。毕竟我们不论支持哪一个方面都不太好写两个独立的理由。

Everyone has their own principles of being a human being, and there are and have been some principles that people are reluctant to change, no matter what changes occur in the external environment. Some people believe that compromising on one's beliefs is more harmful to people than adhering to them. In my opinion, this argument is extremely one-sided. We must analyze each case on its own merits before reaching an objective conclusion.
