It is critically important that students use the best available resources when they do research. In my opinion, it is far better to use online resources than printed materials. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay. 

To begin with, websites like Wikipedia are more up-to-date than printed materials. This is because websites can be edited at zero cost by anyone in the world, regardless of the amount of updated content. As a result of this, even the information of a new COVID-19 strain discovered yesterday can be found on the internet. My own experience demonstrates the timeliness of online resources. In a theoretical physics class, I was assigned a task to investigate a hypothesis. By that time, no progress about the hypothesis can be found in printed books. Nevertheless, I managed to find the newest experiment result supporting the hypothesis by a search engine. As a result, I finished my report in a short time.

Secondly, digital materials are much more portable because they are weightless and take no space. It takes only one iPad to store thousands of research paper, which can be held in one hand. Students who take advantage of commuting time benefit from the portability of digital materials downloaded from the internet. For example, every month I go to visit my parents by air. To utilize the three hours on the plane, I download research papers from the internet beforehand and read them during the trip. Furthermore, there is enough storage space in my iPad so that I am able to always carry with me all the papers I have ever read. If I recall some details in a past paper, I can just find it in my device, instead of going back to the library or somewhere, which saves me a huge amount of time.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that online resources are more useful than printed information. This is because the content on the internet is constantly being updated and because of its portability.



In college, some of my classmates grew up in the countryside, while some of my classmates have lived in a large city since they were born.
Personally, I prefer to be raised up in a metropolis.
I feel this way for several reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

To begin with, urban areas generally have better education resources than rural areas do.
That' s because the economy in large cities is diverse and prosperous and the municipal governments have a sufficient budget for education.
My cousin' s experience is a compelling example of this.
Being brought up in Shanghai, the economy center of China, he received world-class education.
In high school, his English course was taught by a British teacher who graduated from Oxford.
Thanks to her, my cousin now can speak English with native-level fluency.
Therefore, it was easy for him to pass English tests before applying for universities abroad.
On top of that, all his teachers had at least a master's degree.

Secondly, there are more cultural resources in big cities.
Various cultural events and sites only exist in large cities.
For instance, in the weekends, my cousin would visit local museums or go to concerts.
Those cultural activities fostered a sense of art in him at an early age, which enables him to appreciate
fine arts.
Furthermore, he even discovered his passion for music and made up his mind to become a musician in the future.

In conclusion, growing up in a large city is beneficial to the development of children.
On the one hand, they can be educated by the best teachers;
on the other hand, they can be nourished with good culture. 



The reading and the lecture are both about the usage of airships. The author of the reading presents how the airship may be widely used in the future. The lecturer disputes the claims made in the article. His position is that these advantages have serious limitations.

According to the reading, an airship is more economical than a typical aircraft. It is because they only use engines for horizontal movement and thus cost less fuel. This argument is challenged by the lecturer. He claims that airships need special lighter-than-air gas to be airborne, which are either Hydrogen or Helium. Nevertheless, Hydrogen catches fire easily and thus dangerous, while Helium is difficult to obtain, expensive and provides less lifting power than Hydrogen does. 

Secondly, the author suggests that airships may be used to lift heavy load off the ground, regardless of the locations. In the article, it is said that the ability to lift off and land vertically enables airships to do jobs that normal aircraft cannot do. The lecturer, however, asserts that to lift something like tree logs, the airship must come down slowly and keep stable during the process. Nevertheless, the airship is known to be light and can be easily perturbed by a strong windy, which may put the airship in danger by pushing it against trees.

Finally, the author posits that airships can replace satellites. The author contends that airships can also rise high with equipment at a much lower expense. In contrast, the lecturer's stance is that in order to do what satellites do, the airship has to go above 14 kilometers high, where the wind is strong. Therefore, the airship will be forced to spend a lot of fuel to resist the fuel, which will cause it to run out of fuel quickly and need to come down for refuel.
