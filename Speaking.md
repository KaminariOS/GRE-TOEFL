I agree with the statement that all children 

I agree with the idea that people in the future will spend less time on books than they do today. I feel this way for several reasons. First, with the rapid development of technology, more information will be accessible on the Internet. Knowledge that used to exist only in books will be uploaded to some websites like Wikipedia. Therefore, it will be no longer necessary to read books. Second, for entertainment purposes, people in the future will be likely to be fascinated with new kinds of entertainment like virtual reality

I agree with the idea that good handwriting is still of great importance for children to learn. I feel this way for several reasons. First, handwriting is necessary for future examinations. In such major examinations, students are still required to answer the questions by paper and pencil. Therefore, they should learn it at an early age. Second, even after graduation, people still occasionally need to make signatures by hand to sign papers or something. Therefore, they need to practice their handwriting.

Personally, I prefer the idea of attending college full-time. I feel this way for several reasons. First, students need sufficient time to deal with homework and prepare for examinations. For instance, one of my college classmates, who attended college part-time, didn't have enough time to review the materials taught in class before exams. Therefore, he got a low GPA, which caused him to be unable to apply for his dream graduate school. He would have done better if he spent most of his time in college.

I agree with the idea that an university should only spend its budget on academic issues. I feel this way for several reasons. First, students go to college not for fun, but for knowledge. Of course, students are free to entertain themselves with whatever they want. However, that doesn't need to be sponsored by the university.
Second, entertainment activities like movies or concerts may only attract part of the students, while the improvement of academic facilities is beneficial to all students.

Personally, I prefer to have a plan of my free time. I feel this way for several reasons. First, it' s important for us to take full advantage of our free time to realize our dreams. For example, I was dreaming.

I agree with the idea that parents should help their children to decide which university to go. I feel this way for several reasons. First, for most people it' s their parents who pay the college tuition for them. Therefore, their opinions should be taken into consideration. For example, after graduating from high school, I was accepted by a public school and a private school. I personally preferred the private school. However, my parents told me honestly that it was too expensive for them to afford a private school with getting a loan. As a result, after a great of thought, I finally chose the public school.
