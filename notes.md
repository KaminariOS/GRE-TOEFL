- Also, be careful not to pick an answer choice simply because it is a true statement.
- Do not be disturbed if you think all three answer choices are correct, since questions of this type can have up to three correct answer choices.

Sentence equivalence:
- do not simply look among the answer choices for two words that mean the same thing. this can be misleading for two reasons. first, the answer choices may contain pairs of words that mean the same thing but do not fit coherently into the sentence. second, the pair of words that do constitute the correct answer may not mean exactly the same thing, since all that matters is that the resultant sentences mean the same thing.


example essay:
the statement linking tech negatively with the free thinking <mark>plays on</mark> recent human experience over the past century. surely there has been no time in history <mark>where</mark> the <mark>lived lifes</mark> of people have changed more dramtically. a quick reflection on a typical day reveals how technology has revolutionized the world. most people commute to work in an automobile that runs on an internal combustion engine. during the workday, <mark>chances are high that</mark> the employee will interact with a computer that processes information on silicon bridges that are .09 micro wide. upon leaving home, family members will be reached through wireless networks that utilize satellites orbiting the earth. each of these common occurrences could have been unconcievable at the turn of 19 century.

The statement attempts to bridge the dramatic changes to a reduction in the ability for humans to think for themseleves. The assumption is that an increased reliance on technology negates the need for people(individuals) to think creatively to solve previous quandaries. Looking back at the introduction, one could argue that without a car, computer, or  mobile phone, the hypothetical worker would need to find alternate methods of transport, information processing and communication. Technology short circut this thinking by making the problems obsolete.

However, this reliance on technology does not necessarily preclude the creativity that marks the human species. The prior examples reveal that technology allows for convenience. The car, computer and phone all release addtional time for people to live more efficently. This efficiency does not preclude the need for humans to think for themselves. In fact, technology frees humanity to not only tackle new problems, but may itself create new issues that did not exist without technology. For example, the proliferation of automobiles has introduced a need for fuel conservation on a global scale. With increasing energy demands from emerging markets, global warming becomes a concern inconcievable to the horse-and-buggy generation. Likewise dependence on oil has created nation-states that are not dependent on taxation, allowing ruling parties to oppress minority groups such as women. Solutions to these complex problems require the unfettered imagination of maverick scientists and politicians.

In constast to the statement, we can even see how technology frees the human imagination. Consider how the digital revolution and the advent of the internet has allowed for an unprecedented exchange of ideas. WebMD, a popular internet portal for medical information, permits patients to self search symptoms for a more informed doctor visit. This exercise opens pathways of thinking that were previously off closed off to medical layman. With increased interdisciplinary interactions, inspiration can arrive from the most surprising corners. Jeffrey Sachs, one of the architects of theUN Millenium Development Goals, based his ideas on emergency care triage techniques. The unlikely marriage of economics and medicine has headed tense, hyperinflation environments from South America to Eastern Europe.

The last example provides the most hope in how technology actually provides hope to the future of humanity. By increasing our reliance on technology, impossible goals can now be achieved. Consider how the late 20th century witnessed the complete elimination of smallpox. The disease had ravaged the human race since prehistorical days, and yet with the technology of vaccines, free thinking humans dared to image a world free of smallpox. Using technology, battle plans were drawn out, and smallpox was systematically targeted and eradicated.

Technology will always mark the human experience, from the discovery of fire to the implementation of nanotechnology. Given the history of human race, there will be limit for the number of problems, both new and old, for us to tackle.There is no need to retreat to a Luddite attitude to new things, but rather embrace a hopeful posture to the possibilities that technology provides for new avenues of human imagination.

 The statement asserts that in order to support social advance, people should not blindly believe in authority. Authority can be an big organization like the government, or an expert experienced in some field. One thing in common is that authority possess some kind of power, so that people have to rely on them from time to time. Chances are high that most of the time authorities are right and reliable. Usually a professor of history has a deeper insights in the development of Roman empire than her undergraduate students do.

It's tempting to think of authorities as omniscient, but they are not. Knowledge and experience are a double-edge sword that illuminate a clear path to the solution but also is a fetter to innovative thinking. Even Einstein, who established the theory of relativity against old authorities, became a new authority himself, bounded by the theoretical framework he built, unable to recognize the correctness of the rising quantum theory. Image that if had Einstein not questioned the authorities about the speed of light, or if had Bohr not argued with Einstein about the quantum state, physics as a fundamental science would have stagnated and withered. Challenging authorities with creative ideas and constructive opinions doe not means to abasing them but to help them break through their own frame. The same rule applies to not only physics but the whole society.

Furthermore, following authority blindly may lead to a tragic outcome. Authority always have its limitation and will definitely make mistakes. It' s the responsibility of those who follow the authority to keep questioning it to prevent it from taking the wrong path. If people stop raising questions about national policies, politicians may exploit the authority they have for personal profits. People should respect but not rely on authorities. With great power comes great responsibility. It' authority' s responsibility to answer, to explain, so that everyone is convinced this is for the greater good.

Authority is ubiquitous in the society. To a teenager, parents and teachers are authorities. To a worker, the manager is an authority. To a patient, the doctor is authority. People should not be intimidated by the power authority possess and deserves an explanation, so that the well-being of the society is ensured.





The author recommends that a self-management policy like the one in Groveton be practice in all colleges and universities, based on unwarranted assumptions. While this argument seems plausible,  it is rife with flaws including insufficient evidence,  doubtful confessions from the survey, and generalizations.

First, the existing evidence fails to shed light on whether the policy actually disabuses cheating. Fewer reports on cheating from students may result from that the students are reluctant to report their classmates. Maybe there are too many cheaters that other students are worried that the reporting action will make them isolated in the class. If so, the cheating issue may have been exacerbated.

Furthermore,  the representativeness and the reliability of the survey are questionable. How many students participated in the survey? The number of participants may be too small to reflect the situation in the real world and the surveyed group may be heavily biased sexually. Moreover, the confessions from the students may be ingenuine, especially those from cheaters. Students may lie to cover up the cheatings they know or even participated in.

Even if the honor code did alleviate the cheating in Groveton, there is no evidence that the same policy will work well in all other colleges and universities. In some colleges and universites, students may be less upright than those in Groveton and take advantage of the policy to cover up cheating together.

In conclusion,  the argument is flawed due to the above-mentioned reasons and is therefore implausible.  It could be considerably reinforced if the author clearly verifies the implicit assumptions and bring up more substantive evidence. Before that, the honor policy shouldn't be promoted blindly
