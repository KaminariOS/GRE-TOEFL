Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.

Normally, students major in only one or two subjects in college. Some students prefer to concentrate on their field for in-depth knowledge. From my perspective, however, universities should encourage students to explore various courses outside their field of study but allow students to choose their optional courses at will. 

First, every subject doesn't exist independently. Knowledge in one field usually relies on knowledge in another field recursively, especially in natural sciences, which are highly interrelated. For example, theories in physics such as electrodynamics and quantum mechanics rely heavily on theorems deduced by mathematicians and chemical reactions obey physical laws. The ideas from other disciplines may turn out to be beneficial for a better understanding of the student' own field of study. For instance, Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, learned the concept of entropy from thermodynamics and recognized the statistical similarities between matter and information. Therefore, he successfully defined the information entropy, as a measure of the amount of information in a message. It was the logic from physics and mathematics that contributed to his inspiration for inventing the field of information theory. 

Furthermore, in the era of rapid technological development, professional knowledge limited to one field no longer satisfies an increasing demand for interdisciplinary solutions, even with the division of labor. To come up with a systematic approach, an independent problem solver need to face real-world challenges with a broader horizon, which is what optional courses may cultivate. Steven Jobs is a compelling example of this. Back in college, he audited a calligraphy class, which was irrelevant to his major. Nevertheless, that art course fostered in him a sense of aesthetics, which later helped shape the user interface of the first Macintosh. In this case, Steve Jobs was able to see the product from not only the perspective of an engineer but also the perspective of an artist, thanks to that unplanned calligraphy class. His unique spirit persists in the design philosophy of Apple products even after his death.
    One thing to notice is that both Shannon and Jobs step into other fields out of interest, instead of following requirements by university. A student knows himself/herself better than anyone else. Therefore, universities should grant students the freedom to choose what they want to study outside their majors. 

In conclusion, students should not just focus on their fields of study but ought to expand the width of their knowledge. Absorbing knowledge from other related subjects may strengthen the comprehension of your own major, and even subjects that seems irrelevant will turn out to tonic in the future.

2. interest, strength and weakness

Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers.

1. inculcating values that money is everything
2. interest, strength and weakness

keywords: cutthroat competition, inculcating values, materialism

Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise. Others believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.

1. myopic welfare policy
2. leader have more information, make a better judgment

Formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.

1. learn by rote, think out of the box 
2. interest, strength and weakness 

The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people question authority.

1. subject to the supervision of people
2. help to correct implausible policy

Governments should focus on solving the immediate problems of today rather than on trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.

1. help people who are desperately in need 
2. wait for technological progress

Some people believe that college students should consider only their own talents and interests when choosing a field of study. Others believe that college students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.

1. job market change
2. interest, strength and weakness 

Laws should be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places.

1. The real world is too complicated
2. Ultimately it's left to the judge to make the decision, how to interpret, controversial

Claim: The best way to understand the character of a society is to examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses as its heroes or its role models.

Reason: Heroes and role models reveal a society's highest ideals.

1. the definition of success
2. altruism

Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.

1. to prevent scientists to conduct unethical experiment
2. to convince the public to support scientific research 

The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.

1. It'  teachers' responsibility to correct(rectify) misunderstanding or errors. For efficiency
2. Avoid making students feel self-satisfactory

Governments should offer college and university education free of charge to all students.

1. Not every student needs to go to college. Unfair to taxpayers
2. expense too big, may lead to a waste of money

The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.

1. still can be independent
2. the social division of labor ,interest, strength and weakness

In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important contributions.

1. not necessarily true. In fields that have been stagnating, yes;
2. Normally the beginner still need to work with the expert to make contributions.

The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.

A nation where the well-being of its people is secured and talents fulfill themselves is incontrovertibly a great nation. Nevertheless, it's debatable which factor decisively indicates the prosperity of a country. From my perspective, the greatness of a nation results from achievements by the luminaries and results in the welfare of people.

First, a country that is unable to maintain a relatively high living standard for people is by no means successful, even if it processes formidable military power or produces enthralling movies. Real prosperity benefits everyone, not just the rich and privileged. For instance, today China has become the second-largest economy in the world, building aircraft carriers and launching rockets to explore outer space from time to time. There is no doubt that the scientists and engineers in China have been making miracles in modernizing China since the reform and opening-up. Nevertheless, commoners in China still live under huge stress. Many of them have to work for more than 12 hours per day and six days a week to make ends meet because of the ineffective labor law. Furthermore, freedom of speech is not respected by the government, which suffocates the creativity of artists and writers. As the well-educated younger generation longs to escape from this environment, in the long term China will eventually lose its momentum and stagnate with its people suffering from a low living standard. Therefore, China is far from being a great nation unless its population can significantly benefit from the fruit of social development.

However, the well-being of people alone is insufficient for greatness, for it may only be a temporary situation. Unsustainable welfare is misleading, because people living in it blithely ignore the underlying crisis until it breaks out. In Greek, in order to get elected, politicians had no option but to promise voters with more welfare. Consequently, the government was forced to borrow money from foreign countries to make up for the budget deficit. Greeks enjoyed high welfare until the onset of the European debt crisis. After that, Greeks lost their high welfare and have to work for decades to repay their debts. Without technological advantages or cultural industries, short-term affluence will eventually burst like a bubble. And there are nations that become affluent by selling natural resources, such as Saudi Arab. However, nobody will mistake pure luck for greatness. In stark contrast, the Japanese deserve their high-income level and longevity, thanks to the advanced technologies invented by scientists and commercialized cultural products created by artists. It' s the entrepreneurship of the luminaries that drives the nation to keep progressing.

In conclusion, the welfare of people and the accomplishments of the elites are complementary. Welfare fuels creativity and fosters future talents while experts in society fulfill their ideas to elevate the well-being of people. Thus, a nation needs to achieve both of them to be great.





1. short term, long term
2. welfare by selling oid
